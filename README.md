## Contributing

To contribute to Octarine, you'll need a working Java/Kotlin IDE such as IntelliJ and Gradle. The project will autoconfigure at start up.

The project is composed of 7 subprojects:

- `octarine-core` - the core mod internals, magical field, tooling;
- `octarine-brewing`
- `octarine-creatures`
- `octarine-food`
- `octarine-witchery`
- `octarine-wizardry`

And finally, `octarine`, which bundles all of the above into a single JAR for convenience.
